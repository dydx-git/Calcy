# Calcy
A scientific calculator made in Python using native modules

## Getting Started

Clone or just download the ZIP to your desktop.

### Prerequisites

As Calcy uses Python as its language of choice, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. Calcy is cross-platform and uses Tkinter as its UI library so having standard Pyhon libraries installed is required.

### Installing

Just double-click or run Main.py and Calcy will launch.

### Coding Styles

This was not an OOP-based project so the program follows simple programming sequence. Each function is placed in a different file due to college project requirements.
